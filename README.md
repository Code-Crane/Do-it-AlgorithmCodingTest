Overview

This repository contains coding practice and projects completed as part of Ecole Capstone Design at Kyungsung University.
The course is inspired by the philosophy of École 42
, focusing on self-directed, project-based learning without traditional lectures.

During this course, I solve various coding challenges in Python (main language), then re-train by translating the same solutions into Java and JavaScript using AI tools.
This approach helps reinforce algorithmic thinking, improve language fluency, and expand problem-solving skills across multiple programming environments.

🇰🇷 한글 요약

이 리포지토리는 경성대학교 에꼴캡스톤디자인 수업에서 진행한 코딩 연습 결과물입니다.
파이썬으로 문제를 푼 뒤, AI를 활용해 자바·자바스크립트로 변환하여 다시 학습하는 과정을 통해 언어 간 사고 확장과 실무형 문제 해결 능력을 기르는 것을 목표로 합니다.
